# Fishtank
my first 2d fish tank simulator game for android using surfaceview (school project)

it's terrible

but at the very least fun learning experience

features:
- pick your starting population
- set the simulation parameters
- feed the fish
- clean their poop
- watch over their needs and traits in stats
- remove the fish you don't want in your tank
- watch the generations grow and die (child fish inherit properties of parent fish with chance of mutation)
